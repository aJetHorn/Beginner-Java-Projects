##1.Calculate

Assignment: Write two Java Programs. The first, Calculate, should set variables for two different dinner costs and a tip percent, then should print the two dinner costs individually, a total cost pretip, and the cost including the tip. 

The second, Arithmetic, requires variables set for number of friends and the price per dinner at a buffet. Print the price per dinner, the total price if you are paying for all of your friends, how many $20 bills would be needed such that the amount is greater than or equal to the total cost, and, optionally, how much change would be recieved when paying with 20 dollar bills

Status: Finished

Comments: These are both similar. Arithmetic uses type casting.
