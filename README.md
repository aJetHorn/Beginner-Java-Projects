Beginner-Java-Projects
======================

##Summary
This repository will contain a number of Java projects and assignments with a level of difficulty consistent with what may be found in a college intro class. The purpose of many of these projects is for the community explore and gain familiarity with the workings of Java- both what you may find peculiar and what you may find intuitive. 

While the assignments are drawn from a variety of sources (including some written by me), the provided solutions are my own unless otherwise noted. You can use the code within this repository as you please. I'm not doing this for the credit but rather to help people learn Java. I welcome your criticisms, contributions, and suggestions.

##Statement on Academic Dishonesty
If you are a college student, don't cheat on your assignments. If there is a solution provided here that closely replicates your own- please don't copy it verbatim. Don't copy any part of it. Class instructors- If you find an assignment solution identical to an active assignment of yours, do not hesitate to contact me. I am happy to hide certain folders until your assignment's deadline has passed. Chances are, though, that if it exists here, it probably exists elsewhere on the internet.
